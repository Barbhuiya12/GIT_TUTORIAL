# Git Glossary

This glossary provides definitions for key Git terms used throughout this tutorial.

## A

**Add** - The action of moving changes from the working directory to the staging area using `git add`. This prepares changes to be included in the next commit.

**Alias** - A custom shortcut for a Git command that you can define in your Git configuration to save typing.

## B

**Branch** - A lightweight movable pointer to a commit. Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or experiment with ideas in isolation from the main codebase.

**Branching** - The process of creating a new branch from an existing branch or commit.

## C

**Checkout** - The action of switching between different branches or restoring files from a specific commit. In modern Git, `git switch` and `git restore` are preferred for these actions.

**Cherry-pick** - The action of applying a commit from one branch to another. This is useful for applying specific changes without merging entire branches.

**Clone** - Creating a complete copy of a remote repository, including all its files, branches, and commit history, on your local machine.

**Commit** - A snapshot of your project at a specific point in time. Each commit has a unique identifier (hash), author information, timestamp, and commit message.

**Commit Message** - A descriptive message attached to a commit that explains what changes were made and why.

## F

**Fetch** - Downloading commits, files, and refs from a remote repository to your local repository without merging them into your current branch.

## G

**Git** - A distributed version control system designed to track changes in files and coordinate work among multiple people.

**GitHub** - A web-based hosting service for Git repositories that provides additional features like Pull Requests, Issues, and project management tools.

## H

**Hash** - A unique identifier for each commit, generated by Git using the SHA-1 algorithm. Also known as a commit ID.

**HEAD** - A reference to the current commit (or branch tip) that you're working on. It's essentially a pointer to your current location in the commit history.

## I

**Index** - Another name for the staging area, where changes are prepared before being committed.

## L

**Local Repository** - A full copy of a Git repository stored on your local machine, including the complete history of all commits.

## M

**Main** - The default branch name in modern Git repositories, replacing the older convention of using "master".

**Merge** - The process of combining changes from one branch into another. This creates a new merge commit that has multiple parents.

**Merge Conflict** - A situation that occurs when Git cannot automatically merge changes because the same part of a file has been modified in both branches being merged.

## P

**Pull** - A combination of `fetch` and `merge` that downloads changes from a remote repository and immediately merges them into your current branch.

**Pull Request (PR)** - A feature of GitHub (called Merge Request in GitLab) that allows you to propose changes to a repository and request that they be reviewed and merged.

**Push** - The action of sending your local commits to a remote repository.

## R

**Rebase** - An alternative to merging that moves or combines a sequence of commits to a new base commit. It results in a linear history.

**Remote** - A version of your repository hosted on another server (like GitHub). You can push to and pull from remotes.

**Remote Repository** - A Git repository hosted on a server that can be accessed over a network, used for collaboration and backup.

## S

**Stage** - The action of adding changes to the staging area in preparation for a commit.

**Staging Area** - An intermediate area where you prepare changes for the next commit. It allows you to be selective about which changes to include in a commit.

**Stash** - A way to temporarily save changes that are not ready to be committed, allowing you to switch branches or work on something else without committing incomplete work.

## T

**Tag** - A reference to a specific commit, typically used to mark release points (e.g., v1.0, v2.1.3).

## U

**Upstream** - The remote repository and branch that your local branch is tracking. This allows you to use simplified commands like `git push` and `git pull`.

## W

**Working Directory** - The local folder on your computer where you edit files. It contains the current state of the project files.
