# Part 1: The Basics - Introduction to Git

Welcome to the first part of our Git and GitHub tutorial! This section will introduce you to the fundamental concepts of Git.

## What is Git?

Git is a **distributed version control system (DVCS)**. Let's break that down:

*   **Version Control System (VCS):** It's a tool that tracks changes to files over time. This allows you to recall specific versions later, compare changes, and see who made them. Think of it like a "save" button for your entire project, but with the ability to go back to any previous save point.
*   **Distributed:** Unlike centralized version control systems, where the entire history of the project is stored in one central server, Git gives every developer a full copy of the project's history on their local machine. This makes it incredibly fast and allows you to work offline.

## Why use Git?

*   **History and Tracking:** Git keeps a detailed history of every change made to your project.
*   **Collaboration:** Git is designed for teamwork, making it easy for multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously.
*   **Branching and Merging:** You can create separate "branches" to work on new features without affecting the main project. Once a feature is complete, you can merge it back.
*   **Safety Net:** Made a mistake? Git makes it easy to revert to a previous version of your code.

## Git vs. GitHub

This is a common point of confusion for beginners.

*   **Git** is the tool that you install and run on your local machine to track changes.
*   **GitHub** is a web-based platform that hosts your Git repositories. It provides a place to store your projects online, collaborate with others, and use additional features like Pull Requests, Issues, and more.

In short: Git is the tool, and GitHub is the service that hosts projects that use Git.
